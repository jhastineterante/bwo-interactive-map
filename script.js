    description: "With over 41 years in the insurance industry, I've built my career on trust, service, and a genuine love for helping people protect what matters most. I began on the company side, where I spent the first five years of my career assembling policies and ensuring the proper coverage forms were in place. That experience gave me a strong foundation in how insurance programs are structured and how coverage is delivered. Moving to the independent agency side allowed me to focus on what I enjoy most: working directly with clients to find the right coverage at the most affordable price. I specialize in personal, life, and business insurance, and take pride in helping individuals, families, and business owners navigate their options with clarity and confidence. Insurance is not just my profession. It is my passion. There is nothing more rewarding than knowing I've helped someone feel secure and cared for.",
